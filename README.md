Amazon Product Data Extraction and Analysis
This project focuses on extracting product details from Amazon search results using web scraping techniques and analyzing the extracted data to derive insights about product pricing, ratings, and customer feedback. The goal is to provide a comprehensive analysis of the product listings in a specific category to support business decisions.

Project Overview
This project solves the problem of gathering structured data from Amazon’s unstructured HTML pages. The data was collected using BeautifulSoup for web scraping and pandas for data manipulation. The extracted data includes product names, prices, ratings, and the number of reviews. This structured data was then analyzed to identify trends and patterns that can help businesses optimize their product offerings.

Business Understanding
Stakeholders
The primary stakeholders for this project are e-commerce businesses, market analysts, and data professionals who need to understand market trends and customer preferences on Amazon. The data collected can be used to monitor competitors, adjust pricing strategies, and improve product visibility and customer engagement.

Business Problem
The vast amount of product information on Amazon makes it difficult for businesses to manually track competitor prices, ratings, and customer reviews. This project automates the data extraction process, providing businesses with the information needed to make informed decisions. For instance, understanding which products are highly rated but underpriced can help businesses adjust their pricing to capture market share.

Data Understanding
Data Source
The data was collected from an HTML file of Amazon search results, specifically from the bedding category. The HTML content was downloaded on [specific date] and stored locally for parsing.

Data Description
Variables Extracted:
Product Name: The name of the product.
Price: The listed price of the product.
Rating: The average customer rating.
Rating Count: The number of customer reviews.
Data Limitations
The data only covers products displayed on the first few pages of search results and may not represent the entire product category.
Prices and ratings are subject to change, so the data is only accurate as of the date of extraction.
HTML structure changes on Amazon’s website may break the scraping code and require adjustments.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Price Distribution: Visualizes the spread of product prices.
Ratings vs. Reviews: Analyzes the correlation between product ratings and the number of reviews.
Top Reviewed Products: Identifies products with the highest number of customer reviews.
Modeling and Evaluation
Models Used
While this project is primarily focused on data extraction and analysis, there is potential for future modeling, such as:

Price Prediction Model: Using features like rating and review count to predict product price.
Customer Sentiment Analysis: Applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques on customer reviews to assess sentiment and its impact on ratings.
Evaluation Metrics
For regression models predicting product prices, Mean Absolute Error (MAE) can be used.
For classification models like sentiment analysis, metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, and Recall would be appropriate.
Conclusion
Recommendations
Businesses should regularly extract and analyze product data to stay competitive. They can use this data to adjust prices, identify underperforming products, and improve product descriptions based on customer reviews.
Expand the dataset to include more categories and track data over time to capture trends and seasonality effects.
Future Steps
Automate Data Collection: Implement a system to periodically scrape data and update the analysis.
Expand Analysis: Include additional product features and customer reviews for sentiment analysis.
Interactive Dashboard: Develop a dashboard using tools like Tableau or Power BI to visualize key metrics and trends for stakeholders.
